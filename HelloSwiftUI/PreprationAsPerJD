This is a senior iOS engineer job description with expectations that go beyond just iOS coding ‚Äî it blends technical depth, architectural thinking, DevOps awareness, and collaboration with cross-functional teams. Since you already have 13 years of iOS development experience (and leadership experience), your preparation should focus on aligning your skills to the JD and making sure you can demonstrate expertise across iOS, architecture, collaboration, and DevOps practices.

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step prep plan tailored for you:

‚∏ª

üîπ 1. Core iOS & Swift Competence
	‚Ä¢	Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI
	‚Ä¢	Revise key differences (UIKit vs SwiftUI, when to use each).
	‚Ä¢	Practice building small components in SwiftUI.
	‚Ä¢	Show awareness of coexistence strategies (e.g., embedding SwiftUI views in UIKit).
	‚Ä¢	Architecture
	‚Ä¢	Deep dive into MVVM, coordinators, dependency injection.
	‚Ä¢	Be ready to discuss trade-offs between MVC, MVVM, VIPER, and Clean Architecture.
	‚Ä¢	Practice explaining how you structure a modular codebase (e.g., frameworks, Swift Packages).
	‚Ä¢	Design Patterns & Principles
	‚Ä¢	Review SOLID, DRY, KISS and apply them to real iOS scenarios.
	‚Ä¢	Patterns: Singleton, Observer (Combine/NotificationCenter/KVO), Factory, Dependency Injection.
	‚Ä¢	Testing
	‚Ä¢	Hands-on with XCTest, Snapshot testing (iOSSnapshotTestCase/pointfreeco snapshotting).
	‚Ä¢	Be able to set up unit tests + UI tests.
	‚Ä¢	Practice writing a test-first small feature (TDD style).

‚∏ª

üîπ 2. Cross-Functional Collaboration
	‚Ä¢	UX & Design Collaboration
	‚Ä¢	Refresh on Apple HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) and standard UI/UX design principles.
	‚Ä¢	Be able to critique designs constructively (e.g., accessibility, performance, maintainability).
	‚Ä¢	API Team Collaboration
	‚Ä¢	Be strong on REST API consumption in iOS (URLSession, async/await, Codable).
	‚Ä¢	Understand error handling, retries, caching, background uploads.
	‚Ä¢	Prepare to talk about API versioning and backward compatibility in apps.

‚∏ª

üîπ 3. Beyond iOS (Desirable Skills)

The ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù section is where you can stand out, even if you‚Äôre not an expert:
	‚Ä¢	Web & Hybrid:
	‚Ä¢	Have basic awareness of React, React Native, Flutter ‚Äî understand trade-offs vs. native.
	‚Ä¢	Know when to use cross-platform vs native.
	‚Ä¢	Backend Awareness:
	‚Ä¢	Revise fundamentals of REST APIs, JSON, NodeJS basics.
	‚Ä¢	Be able to explain how mobile apps interact with backend services securely.
	‚Ä¢	DevOps & CI/CD:
	‚Ä¢	Get familiar with Fastlane for iOS automation.
	‚Ä¢	Review CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
	‚Ä¢	Understand code signing, provisioning profiles, release automation.
	‚Ä¢	Learn basics of Docker/Kubernetes (at least conceptually: containers, scaling, deployment).
	‚Ä¢	Security:
	‚Ä¢	Revise Keychain, biometrics, data encryption, secure API handling.
	‚Ä¢	Know about OWASP Mobile Top 10 vulnerabilities.

‚∏ª

üîπ 4. Agile & Leadership
	‚Ä¢	Review Agile ceremonies (scrum, sprint planning, retrospectives).
	‚Ä¢	Be prepared to show examples of mentoring juniors, reviewing PRs, enforcing coding standards.
	‚Ä¢	Prepare stories where you influenced architecture/design in a project.

‚∏ª

üîπ 5. Interview Prep Strategy
	1.	Technical Round ‚Äì Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, architecture, design patterns, testing.
	‚Ä¢	Practice system design for mobile: e.g., ‚ÄúDesign a scalable inspection app with offline sync.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Be able to explain how you modularize frameworks.
	2.	Coding Round ‚Äì Solve a Swift coding challenge with clean, testable code.
	‚Ä¢	Practice LeetCode Easy/Medium (arrays, strings, trees) in Swift.
	‚Ä¢	Implement simple apps with MVVM + tests.
	3.	Architecture/DevOps Round ‚Äì
	‚Ä¢	Be ready to whiteboard a CI/CD pipeline for iOS.
	‚Ä¢	Discuss API architecture and security practices.
	4.	Behavioral Round ‚Äì
	‚Ä¢	Prepare STAR-method answers: ‚ÄúTell me about a time you mentored someone,‚Äù ‚ÄúHandled production issue,‚Äù etc.

‚∏ª

üîπ 6. Preparation Timeline

Since you already have strong iOS depth, here‚Äôs how you could prepare in 6‚Äì8 weeks:
	‚Ä¢	Week 1‚Äì2: Refresh Swift, SwiftUI/UIKit, MVVM, SOLID principles.
	‚Ä¢	Week 3‚Äì4: Testing (Unit/UI/Snapshot), API integration, modular frameworks.
	‚Ä¢	Week 5: CI/CD (Fastlane, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines), security basics.
	‚Ä¢	Week 6: DevOps concepts (Docker/Kubernetes), cross-platform awareness.
	‚Ä¢	Week 7: Mock interviews (system design + behavioral).
	‚Ä¢	Week 8: Revise + build a small demo app showcasing: SwiftUI + MVVM + modular architecture + API + testing + CI/CD.

‚∏ª

üëâ Given your 13 years iOS experience + leadership background, the key is to show breadth (architecture, DevOps, cross-platform awareness) without losing depth (iOS expertise).

Would you like me to draft a focused roadmap with learning resources (articles, courses, GitHub projects) for each of the sections (Core iOS, DevOps, Testing, Security, Cross-Platform), so you can follow a structured weekly plan?
